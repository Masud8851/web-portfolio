            <p>I’m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; dabbling with Python and Ruby; and inhaling a wide variety of   potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.
                I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction.
