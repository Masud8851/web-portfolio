            <h3>World-class professional web developer</h3>
            <p>I’m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; dabbling with Python and Ruby; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well. I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction.</p>

            <p>I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even teach my friends how to make a simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.</p>
